Here you set which sections your service consists of, such as quick songs, worship songs, collection songs or songs at a call or end of the service, prayer requests or Bible texts with the sermon, etc. In other words, everything you want to have slides with. One or more labels then fall under these sections. You can tag your songs so that they will automatically be placed in this section. So a collection has labels and labels fall under a section of your service.\n\nAfter you have determined the order you need to label the collections (song service songs) under the \"Collections\" tab.
